                “If I die, I will drag you to hell and torment you for eternity.” Jules
wrapped an arm around my waist, her face several shades paler than usual as
we shuffled toward the edge of the platform.
Behind us, the bungee jump operator checked our harnesses one last time.
“If you die, I die, Red.” I grinned and kissed her cheek. “Hell with you
sounds like heaven to me.”
Her tense expression cracked. “That was corny as fuck, Josh.”
“Yeah, so? I’m hot enough to pull it off.” I peered down at the river
below us. “Besides, you may want to be nice to me. You don’t want our last
words to be insults, do you?”
It was our last full day in New Zealand, and we were at Queenstown’s
Kawarau Bridge for a tandem bungee jump. Jules had taken all our previous
activities in stride—skydiving, paragliding, whooshing across a canyon with
the Shotover Canyon Swing. But she’d never looked as nervous as she did
now.
Her face paled further. “Don’t say that.”
“I’m kidding, I’m kidding.” I tightened my arm around her waist. “We’ll
be fine. Trust me.”
“We better be, or I promise, I’ll let Cerberus bite your genitals off.”
I grinned. I loved when she got violent.
“Are you ready?” The operator asked, keeping a hold on the backs of our
harnesses.
I looked at Jules, who took a deep breath and nodded.
“We’re good,” I said.
